# Digital Transformation of Healthcare
## An Introduction to Data-Driven Healthcare

This course is an exploration of the modern healthcare informatics pipeline, highlighting core components within the context of real-world applications.  Through a mix of discussion and case based learning, each class will examine steps along the pipeline, how they fit into the larger informatics framework, as well as an analysis of their implementation based on real-world projects.  Some steps we will analyze include: clinical decision support, cohort selection, ethics of model building, artificial intelligence and machine learning within healthcare.  After completing this course students will be able to design complete informatics pipelines to use within their own research.  As the course progresses, students will be expected to present on components of informatics pipeline within their specific domains and opportunities for future informatics applications.  For the final project, teams of students will be expected to propose new domain-specific informatics pipelines.
